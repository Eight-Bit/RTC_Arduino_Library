# RTC Arduino Library

This is a fork of JeeLab's RTC Library [[1]] for Arduino.

It's a easy to use Library for communication with RTCs (Real Time Clock) for Arduino.

## Installation
* Unpack the archive and rename the resulting folder to "RTClib".
* Move it to the "libraries" folder in your Arduino sketches area.
* Restart the Arduino IDE to make sure it sees the new files.
